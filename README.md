This is my (hopeful) implementation of the 'knight travails' problem from TheOdinProject, also known as 'Minimum Knight Moves' from sites like LeetCode.

To run it, instantiate a new Traversal object, and call the calculateMoves() method, passing the desired X and Y coordinates as its' two arguments. 

The method will return an amount of moves it takes to reach it, an array of arrays containing the path taken.

Results will be logged to the console.
